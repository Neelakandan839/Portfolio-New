# Concierge — Real-Time Lead Management & Campaign Platform

## Overview

Concierge is a powerful web platform designed for real estate businesses to manage leads, agents, and marketing campaigns using real-time data and AI-driven automation. It provides agents and administrators with a centralized control hub to boost efficiency, decision-making, and conversion rates.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time analytics with Nivo charts and custom date filtering to monitor platform activity and KPIs.
- **Lead Management CRM**:
  - View, filter, and manage leads by status/stage.
  - Read and reply to customer conversations powered by an AI chatbot.
  - Access overall chat summaries and lead insights.
- **Campaign Management**:
  - Create new marketing campaigns and view current, paused, or completed ones.
  - Activate or pause campaigns easily.
  - Date range filter to evaluate campaign performance.
- **Agent Setup**:
  - Manage a list of real estate projects and assigned agents.
  - Create new agents and update role-based access.
- **Customer Summary View**:
  - See overall lead health, AI-generated chat scores, full chat history, CRM notes, and lead lookup via mobile number.
- **Settings**:
  - Manage user profiles, billing details, and subscription plans.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, routing, and scalable architecture.
- **Material UI**: For consistent and responsive UI components.
- **Python (FastAPI)**: Backend APIs powering business logic and AI chat processing.
- **MongoDB**: For storing structured lead, chat, and campaign data.
- **Nivo Charts**: For beautiful, interactive visualizations on the dashboard.
- **OpenAI**: Integrated GPT-based chatbot to enhance lead conversations and summarization.

## My Role

I worked as the lead full-stack developer, contributing across the board:

- Developed the dashboard, campaign management, and agent setup modules using Next.js and Material UI.
- Built backend APIs in Python (FastAPI) to handle chat, CRM logic, and data queries.
- Integrated OpenAI’s API to enable dynamic AI chatbot conversations and customer summaries.
- Created reusable chart components using Nivo for real-time analytics.
- Ensured secure, responsive user experience across desktop and mobile views.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Merging AI chatbot output with structured CRM logic involved managing varied conversation data formats and fallback scenarios.
- Building dynamic filtering and real-time chart updates required performance tuning with large datasets.
- Designing a clean, role-based interface that works seamlessly for both agents and admins taught me the importance of modular layouts and access control layers.

## Outcome

Concierge streamlined lead generation, follow-up, and campaign workflows into one intuitive interface:

- Helped real estate teams respond to leads faster using AI-driven insights.
- Enabled smart tracking of campaign ROI and lead quality.
- Centralized agent and project management for scale and collaboration.

## Future Roadmap

- Add multi-channel campaign support (email, WhatsApp).
- Introduce automated AI lead scoring and follow-up suggestions.
- Enhance billing features with invoice history and usage stats.
