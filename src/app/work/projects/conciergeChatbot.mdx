# Concierge (Anya) — AI-Powered Real Estate Chatbot

## Overview

**Concierge (Anya)** is a next-generation AI chatbot designed to automate customer engagement and lead generation in the real estate domain. Built specifically for the Urbanrise brand, it provides instant, human-like responses to buyer queries — ranging from amenities to pricing, floor plans, and location benefits — with full visual support like 3D layouts, interactive maps, and voiceover tours.

## Key Features

- **Conversational AI**: Anya answers user questions instantly about projects, pricing, locations, and more — no human support needed.
- **Voice-Powered Agent**: Built-in animated voiceover introduces the brand and gives guided walkthroughs for new users.
- **3D Floor Plan Viewer**: Interactive, rotatable layouts let users visualize units in real-time (powered by WebGL).
- **Location and Amenity Visuals**: Shows static and animated content including maps, master plans, clubhouse features, and nearby landmarks.
- **Smart Context Awareness**: Dynamically changes content based on the question context (e.g., shows location map when user asks “Where is the project?”).
- **Lead Generation**: Captures customer data from interactions and qualifies them automatically as potential buyers.
- **Intro Animation**: Engaging intro screen with space-themed animation for first-time users to build interest and immersion.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Frontend structure and routing.
- **Material UI**: Component library used for clean layout and responsive interface.
- **Babylon.js**: For real-time interactive 3D rendering of building layouts and objects.
- **OpenAI GPT**: Natural language understanding and content generation.
- **Python (FastAPI)**: Backend for handling queries, data logging, and AI orchestration.
- **MongoDB**: Data storage for leads, chat logs, and customer behavior.

## My Role

I was responsible for building the complete AI chatbot interface and logic from scratch:

- Integrated OpenAI for natural language interaction.
- Developed the 3D floor plan module using Babylon.js and ensured seamless integration with the chat.
- Implemented animated avatar intro and voiceovers using speech synthesis.
- Built dynamic logic for visual content switching (location, layout, master plan, etc.) based on chat triggers.
- Designed the lead-capture mechanism and chatbot memory to retain user context across queries.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Creating real-time 3D floor plan interactions while keeping the UI smooth and mobile-friendly was a tough but rewarding challenge.
- Managing chatbot context and routing different types of user queries (visual, text, location-based) required modular NLP flow design.
- Building a self-guided user onboarding with animation, voice, and brand storytelling helped me understand product storytelling via code.

## Outcome

- Fully eliminated the need for manual real estate support in the early lead generation phase.
- Users spent more time exploring, leading to higher-quality leads for sales teams.
- Set a new UX benchmark for interactive real estate exploration using conversational AI and 3D visual engagement.

## Future Roadmap

- Add multilingual support and speech-to-text input.
- Enable WhatsApp/website integration for wider lead access.
- Train chatbot on project-specific price negotiation patterns for semi-automated bookings.
