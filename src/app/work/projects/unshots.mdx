# Unshots — Immersive AR/VR NFT Platform

## Overview

Unshots is a cutting-edge digital platform built to empower creators and users to experience, create, and mint immersive AR/VR video content as NFTs. The goal was to bridge high-fidelity virtual experiences with blockchain utility.

## Key Features

- **AR/VR Video Integration**: Users can upload, preview, and explore spatial video content in a 3D immersive environment.
- **NFT Minting**: Built-in support for converting immersive content into NFTs, enabling monetization and Web3 ownership.
- **Responsive Web UI**: Developed with React and Tailwind CSS to deliver a smooth, modern UX across devices.
- **Wallet Connect & Blockchain Integration**: Integrated with MetaMask and smart contracts for NFT minting.
- **Dynamic Gallery**: Real-time rendering of featured drops, popular NFTs, and creator portfolios.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For performant SSR and scalable architecture.
- **Three.js / A-Frame**: For immersive 3D visualizations and AR/VR interactivity.
- **Solidity & Web3.js**: To enable NFT minting and blockchain transactions.
- **Material UI**: For rapid, clean UI development.
- **IPFS / Truffle**: For decentralized asset hosting.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Rendering AR/VR content across devices while keeping the UI responsive was a significant technical challenge.
- NFT minting flows required extra care for wallet connection, gas estimation, and error handling.
- Syncing blockchain logic with real-time UI states needed Web3 event listeners and thoughtful fallback UX.

## Outcome

Unshots successfully demonstrated how AR/VR and Web3 can combine in a single intuitive experience. The platform:

- Attracted early adopters from the NFT and immersive creator space.
- Became a portfolio centerpiece for demonstrating full-stack + blockchain + 3D integration.
- Inspired plans for scaling with social features, token-gated experiences, and creator monetization models.
